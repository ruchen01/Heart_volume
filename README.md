# Heart_volume

We want to help diagnose heart diseases by data science! 

I found MRI videos with 30-frame in Dicom format. There are total 700 patients' data to train and validate. The problem was originally from Kaggle 2015 data science bowl. Top 3 winners all use convolutional neural networks, but ResNet architecture was not posted back then. 
Here I show how the performance can be boosted by ResNet on one's laptop, by using only 5 full iterations with minibatches and Adam optimizers. To get a even better performance, I need a more powerful machine!
